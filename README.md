# Bird-Classification-using-Deep-Learning


Overview:
This project involves classifying bird species using images. We implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to automatically recognize different bird species from a dataset of bird images. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and potential improvements for future work.


Dataset:
The dataset used for this project includes images of various bird species. The dataset was split into training, validation, and test sets.
Training set: Used to train the CNN model.
Validation set: Used to tune hyperparameters and avoid overfitting.
Test set: Used to evaluate the final model's performance.

Preprocessing:
Data Augmentation: Applied transformations such as rotation, flipping, and scaling to increase the diversity of the training data.
Normalization: Scaled pixel values to the range [0, 1].

Model Architecture:
The CNN architecture used for this project consists of the following layers:
Convolutional Layer: Extracts features from the input images using filters.
Activation Layer: Applies a non-linear activation function (ReLU) to introduce non-linearity.
Pooling Layer: Reduces the dimensionality of the feature maps.
Dropout Layer: Randomly drops units to prevent overfitting.
Flatten Layer: Converts the 2D feature maps into a 1D vector.
Dense Layer: Fully connected layer for classification.
Output Layer: Softmax activation for multi-class classification.

Training:
Loss Function: Categorical cross-entropy.
Optimizer: Adam optimizer.
Metrics: Accuracy.

Evaluation:
The model's performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Confusion matrices and ROC curves were also generated for a detailed analysis.

Results:
Training Accuracy: X%
Validation Accuracy: Y%
Test Accuracy: Z%

Future Work:
Experiment with Deeper Architectures: Test more complex CNN architectures like ResNet or Inception.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize learning rates, batch sizes, and other hyperparameters.
Transfer Learning: Use pre-trained models to improve performance.
Data Augmentation: Explore more augmentation techniques to further diversify the training data.

Conclusion:
The project successfully implemented a CNN for bird species classification. The model achieved good performance but there is room for improvement through deeper architectures, hyperparameter tuning, and transfer learning.
